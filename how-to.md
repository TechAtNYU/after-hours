# Running After Hours

Congratulations! You're running After Hours today. Thank you so much!

After Hours is our flagship event. It's where the community comes together, every week, to learn and meet each other. After Hours is a low-pressure and safe environment. As hosts for this week, your responsibilities are:

1. Foster community and friendships amongst attendees
2. Make sure tech@NYU questions are answered and people feel good
3. Take care of the eLab space and staff
4. Organize pizza and drinks within the $80 budget

# Workflow

This is an iterative process. Any recommendations you may have (after running one yourself) are ace!

1. Arrive before 6pm
2. Talk with the eLab staff
3. Greet anyone who comes by asking if they're for After Hours
4. Check them into the API using http://checkin.tnyu.org/ - use a board member's computer, since it logs you out of FB automatically
5. Have conversations with other people or introduce them to each other (The Brenton Method)
6. Answer any questions that they may have about tech@NYU or After Hours
7. Order pizza - see Pizza Workflow
8. Tidy up the eLab space. Make sure trash isn't strewn about and things look good.

### Pizza Workflow

- Domino's on 8th Street
- Order through the website
- Send people to pick up, they don't deliver to eLab for some reason
- $80 cap for now

We used to order from Pizza Mercato under Bob's tenure, but it was expensive. Other ideas such as polling for food before After Hours were time-consuming and cost prohibitive.

We are working to get more funds through Collab Fund since we now co-sponsor with ACM. Once this happens, we can revise our food policy.
